# Design Roadmap for Terraform AI Agent Improvements

## Executive Summary
This consolidated roadmap synthesizes analyses from performance bottlenecks, AI efficiency, data handling, UI/UX, scalability, and code maintainability to create a unified plan for enhancing the agent's efficiency. The current system is modular and functional for small projects but can be optimized for speed (3-5x faster queries/startup), cost (50% token reduction), scalability (10x larger projects), and maintainability (80% test coverage). Prioritization: Quick wins first, then structural, advanced last. Implementation in phases; total ~1-2 months. Metrics: Benchmark latency/tokens/memory before/after.

Key Themes:
- **Performance**: Async everything, caching, rule-based routing.
- **AI**: Structured prompts, history summarization, HCL-aware RAG.
- **Data**: Parallel processing, incremental updates, optimized DB.
- **UI/UX**: Non-blocking, shortcuts, incremental renders.
- **Scalability**: Workspace isolation, cloud integration.
- **Maintainability**: Custom errors, retries, full tests.

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (1 Week, High Impact/Low Effort)
Focus on immediate efficiency gains without major refactors.

1. **Rule-Based Routing for Simple Queries** (AI + Performance)
   - Detect patterns (e.g., "how many VMs") via regex; answer from cache without LLM.
   - Steps: Extend agent.py patterns; format from TaskEngine cache; fallback to AI.
   - Impact: 40-60% fewer LLM calls; 1-2s faster queries.
   - Effort: Low (50 lines); No deps.

2. **History Summarization & Token Budgeting** (AI Efficiency)
   - Summarize history every 5 turns; truncate prompts to 4k tokens.
   - Steps: Add summarize method in LangChainProcessor; use tiktoken estimator; prioritize recent + summary.
   - Impact: 40% token savings; prevents overflow.
   - Effort: Low; Uses existing tiktoken.

3. **Async Subprocess for Terraform CLI** (Performance + Maintainability)
   - Use asyncio.create_subprocess_exec; stream output.
   - Steps: Refactor cli.py _run_command to async; await in TaskEngine; live UI updates.
   - Impact: Non-blocking ops; smoother UX.
   - Effort: Medium; No deps.

4. **Slash Commands & Input History** (UI/UX)
   - Add /plan, /resources; readline history.
   - Steps: Integrate prompt_toolkit; map prefixes in Agent; update help.
   - Impact: 30% fewer keystrokes.
   - Effort: Low-Medium; Dep: prompt_toolkit.

## Phase 2: Structural Enhancements (2-3 Weeks, Balanced Impact)
Deeper refactors for core improvements.

1. **Custom HCL-Aware Chunking & Hybrid Retrieval** (Data + AI)
   - Chunk by HCL blocks; semantic + keyword search.
   - Steps: Custom splitter in langchain_processor (hcl2 parse); EnsembleRetriever; metadata filters.
   - Impact: 25-40% better relevance; 20% fewer chunks.
   - Effort: Medium; Dep: rank_bm25.

2. **Advanced Caching with Invalidation** (Data Handling)
   - LRU/TTL; file-watch triggers.
   - Steps: cachetools LRU in TaskEngine/Processor; watchdog for changes; disk serialize.
   - Impact: 70% fewer re-parses; <1s startup.
   - Effort: Medium; Dep: cachetools.

3. **Workspace Manager & Selective Parsing** (Scalability)
   - Per-ws cache/RAG; include/exclude.
   - Steps: New workspace_manager.py; filters in Parser; UI /ws command.
   - Impact: Multi-env support; faster subsets.
   - Effort: Medium; No deps.

4. **Custom Exceptions & Retries** (Maintainability)
   - Typed errors; backoff for APIs.
   - Steps: exceptions.py; raise specifically; tenacity @retry on LLM/CLI.
   - Impact: Better debugging/resilience.
   - Effort: Low; Dep: tenacity.

## Phase 3: Advanced/Strategic (1-2 Months, High Value)
For production/enterprise.

1. **Full Async Migration & Distributed Components** (Performance + Scalability)
   - Async I/O/LLM; cloud DB/execution.
   - Steps: aiofiles, AsyncOpenAI; Pinecone for RAG; Terraform Cloud API; FastAPI backend.
   - Impact: Horizontal scale; team collab.
   - Effort: High; Deps: aiofiles, pinecone-client, redis, fastapi.

2. **Comprehensive Testing Suite** (Maintainability)
   - Unit/integration/e2e; 80% coverage.
   - Steps: pytest structure; mock externals; async tests; CI with GitHub Actions.
   - Impact: Regression-free.
   - Effort: High; Deps: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock.

3. **UI Incremental Rendering & Non-Blocking** (UI/UX + Performance)
   - Live updates; background processing.
   - Steps: Rich Live for logs/status; async input.
   - Impact: Smoother long ops.
   - Effort: Medium-High; No new deps.

## Monitoring & Rollout
- **Benchmarks**: Time startup/queries; token counts; memory (psutil).
- **Phased Rollout**: Test each phase with sample-terraform; A/B for UX.
- **Deps Update**: requirements.txt: Add phased (e.g., Phase1: prompt_toolkit; Phase3: full stack).
- **Risks**: Async bugs (race conditions); test thoroughly; backward compat for sync.
- **Success Metrics**: <2s queries, <5s startup, 50% cost down, handle 5k resources.

This roadmap evolves the agent into a robust, efficient tool. For implementation, start with Phase 1.
