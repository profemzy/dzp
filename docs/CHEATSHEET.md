## üß† Intelligent Query Routing

The app **automatically** chooses between standard and DeepAgents processing based on query complexity:

### ‚ö° Simple Queries (Standard Processor - Fast)

These use the **standard processor** for quick responses (1-3 seconds):

```
What resources are in this configuration?
Show me all S3 buckets
How many VMs do I have?
Run terraform plan
Analyze security of this infrastructure
What's the estimated cost?
List all EC2 instances
Validate the configuration
```

**Why fast?** Single-domain, straightforward questions don't need multi-agent coordination.

### ü§ñ Complex Queries (DeepAgents - Powerful)

These automatically trigger **DeepAgents multi-agent orchestration** (15-30 seconds):

```
Plan a migration from AWS to Azure with cost analysis and security review
Perform a comprehensive SOC2 compliance audit and create a remediation roadmap
Optimize costs while maintaining security compliance and create implementation plan
Design a blue-green deployment strategy with rollback procedures and cost estimates
Analyze our infrastructure for CIS benchmark violations, estimate remediation costs, and create a 60-day implementation plan
Should I migrate from VMs to Kubernetes? Provide cost comparison, security implications, and migration strategy
```

**Why DeepAgents?** Multi-domain, multi-step workflows benefit from coordinated expert agents:
- **Security Auditor**: Security analysis and compliance checking
- **Cost Optimizer**: Cost optimization and resource sizing
- **Deployment Validator**: Deployment validation and testing
- **Migration Planner**: Infrastructure migration planning

## üí° Pro Tips

### ‚úÖ **DO:**
- Ask questions naturally in plain English
- Be specific about what you want to know
- Use follow-up questions like "why?" or "tell me more"
- Combine queries: "Check if deployed, then validate configuration"
- Ask for explanations: "Explain why this is configured this way"
- **Let the app decide**: Don't worry about which processor to use - intelligent routing handles it!

### ‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Use exact Terraform syntax in questions (agent understands natural language)
- Worry about command formatting (agent translates for you)
- Repeat the same question (use conversation history)
- Manually toggle DeepAgents on/off (it's automatic now!)

### üß† **Understanding Routing:**
- **Trigger words for DeepAgents**: "migrate", "audit", "roadmap", "comprehensive", "plan for", "strategy"
- **Multi-domain queries**: Combining "security + cost", "compliance + migration" triggers DeepAgents
- **Simple is fast**: Single-topic questions always use the fast processor
- **Complex is thorough**: Multi-step workflows get full multi-agent treatment

### üéØ **Examples of Great Prompts:**

```
"I want to deploy this, but first check if it's valid and show me what will be created"

"What security risks exist, and how can I fix them?"

"Compare the defined resources with what's actually deployed"

"Before I apply, show me the plan and explain any concerning changes"

"What's deployed, what's its status, and what does it cost?"
```

## üîÑ Conversation Flow Examples

### Example 1: Pre-Deployment Check
```
You: What resources are defined?
Agent: [Lists 8 resources from config]

You: Are any of them already deployed?
Agent: [Checks state and compares]

You: Run a plan and show me what will be created
Agent: [Executes terraform plan with analysis]

You: Looks good, apply it
Agent: [Confirms and applies with warnings]
```

### Example 2: Security Review
```
You: Analyze the security of my infrastructure
Agent: [Extended thinking analysis]

You: What's the biggest risk?
Agent: [Identifies NSG rule allowing SSH from anywhere]

You: How do I fix it?
Agent: [Provides specific configuration changes]

You: Show me the updated config
Agent: [Displays corrected configuration]
```

### Example 3: Troubleshooting
```
You: Why did my apply fail?
Agent: [Analyzes error output]

You: What resources are actually created?
Agent: [Checks state for partial deployment]

You: How do I clean this up?
Agent: [Suggests terraform destroy or targeted actions]
```

## üé® Natural Language Freedom

The agent understands variations and synonyms:

- **"Show me"** = "List" = "Display" = "What are" = "Get"
- **"Created"** = "Deployed" = "Provisioned" = "Exists" = "Running"
- **"Resources"** = "Infrastructure" = "Assets" = "Components"
- **"Check"** = "Validate" = "Verify" = "Confirm" = "Review"

**Be natural, be conversational, be specific!** üöÄ
