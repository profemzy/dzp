# Fix Terraform Plan Execution Context

## Problem
- Terraform commands are running in the main project directory (`/Users/profemzy/playground/dzp`)
- But the actual terraform files are in `./examples/sample-terraform/`
- This causes terraform plan to show "0 resources" instead of the actual 8 resources
- AI responses about infrastructure state are incorrect

## Solution Steps

### Phase 1: Diagnose the Issue
- [x] Identify that terraform commands run in wrong directory
- [x] Confirm terraform files exist in examples directory
- [x] Verify terraform plan shows incorrect results

### Phase 2: Fix the Configuration
- [ ] Update agent configuration to use correct terraform directory
- [ ] Ensure terraform commands execute in examples/sample-terraform/
- [ ] Test terraform plan in correct directory

### Phase 3: Verify AI Responses
- [ ] Test "Are these resources already applied in state?" question
- [ ] Verify AI gives accurate response about terraform state
- [ ] Ensure terraform plan shows actual resources (8 resources)

### Phase 4: Test Complete Workflow
- [ ] Test resource counting questions
- [ ] Test terraform plan execution
- [ ] Test state-related questions
- [ ] Verify all responses are accurate

## Expected Results
- Terraform plan should show 8 resources in examples directory
- AI should correctly answer questions about infrastructure state
- All terraform commands should execute in correct directory
